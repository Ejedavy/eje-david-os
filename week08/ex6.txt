16-bit virtual addresses
8 KB pages

Using a 16 bit addressing, we can store up to 2^16 bytes of memory. This is the size of the virtual memory. It is given that the size of each page is 8KB ( 2^13 bytes). 

The number of pages is 2 ^ (16 -13) which is 8.

The number of pages is equal to the number of entries in the page table.
So the answer is 8
